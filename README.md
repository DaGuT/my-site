# This is my entire source code for my DaGuT.Ru site.
I dont have any special plans to use it(may be I do, but only as my Personal page), It's just made for learning purposes and to see if I can do things


You can check working demo at [DaGuT.Ru (clickable)](https://dagut.ru/) (it's not always up to date)

## Special features:
* React components that are built by me (feel free to use them in your project if you want. They are not too flexible, but at least they work)
* I have block-built index page, meaning that you can put as much react blocks(1 file per block) as you want an they will be displayed without having to manually link them, include or whatever.
* Resortable index page, meaning you can simply drag and drop blocks and they'll be drawn in new order (you can add "save" feature to remember the order). I did that for fun just to see if I can do it
* Online "snake" block which allows you to compete for food with your friends :D (no goal, just for fun)

## Currently wanted things:
- [ ] Admin panel for adding portfolio item
- [ ] Admin panel functionality for managing those items (not soon)
- [ ] Nice footer
- [ ] Redux support? Idk
- [ ] Multiplayer drawing block with websockets (not sure if I need that)
- [ ] Better JSdocing
- [x] Portfolio block with json database
- [x] Better readme
- [x] Multiplayer snake with cloud server (Yeah!)
