# my-site
This is my site and all its sources

You can check working demo at [DaGuT.Ru (clickable)](https://dagut.ru/demos/mysite) (it's not always up to date)

##Special features:
* React components that are built by me (feel free to use them in your project if you want. They are not too flexible, but at least they work)
* You have block-built index page, meaning that you can put as much react blocks(1 file per block) as you want an they will be displayed without having to manually link them, include or whatever.
* Resortable index page, meaning you can simply drag and drop blocks and they'll be drawn in new order (you can add "save" feature to remember the order). I did that for fun just to see if I can do it


UPD 11.04.2018 I'll update site soon. Just busy with my diploma now
