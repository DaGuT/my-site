If you want, you can just easily spawn snake canvas anywhere.

All you need to do is include sketch.js (and copy all the files from snake folder) in you file where you'll spawn it, and then add
this code below and replace YourID with your element ID where snake will spawn. That's it. Easy as that.
And if you want to have multiplayer snake - feel free to add socketServer, if you dont want - dont pass it to p5()

Server files are in server folder. Just feel free to run it via "node snake.js"


--------------------------

//js
let snakeId = 'YourID';
let socketServer = 'YourServer'; //e.g. 'http://localhost:3000'
new p5(snakeSketch(snakeId,socketServer), snakeId);

//Plus  this code to css
#YourID {
  position: relative;
  /* fix for canvas background */
}

--------------------------


If you want to stop canvas (noLoop()) when it's out of viewpoint, then add onVisibilityChange.js from misc.
