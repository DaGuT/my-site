If you want, you can just easily spawn snake canvas anywhere.

All you need to do is include sketch.js (and copy all the files from snake folder) in you file where you'll spawn it, and then add
this code below and replace YourID with your element ID where snake will spawn. That's it. Easy as that.


--------------------------

//js
let snakeId = 'YourID';
new p5(snakeSketch(snakeId), snakeId);

//Plus  this code to css
#YourID {
  position: relative;
  /* fix for canvas background */
}

--------------------------


If you want to stop canvas (noLoop()) when it's out of viewpoint, then add onVisibilityChange.js from misc.
